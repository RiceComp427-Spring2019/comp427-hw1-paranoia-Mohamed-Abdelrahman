## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Stadium} - I oversee the football stadium at a university whose team is frequently ranked among the best in the country.
- Assumptions:
  - I assume it is a covered stadium.
  - I assume that all of the employees in the stadium are not of any threat. 
  - I assume that I'm not in charge of securing the parking lot of the stadium. The organization of the parking will be left completely to the police department under the chief's supervision. This includes making sure the keys of cars are secured and to be given to the right people. In addition, preventing thefts and making sure the lot is secured is part of the police's responsibility as well.
- Assets:
  - Protect the stadium infrastructure and all of the stores inside.
  - Protect the lives of everyone in the stadium.
- Threats:
  - Any terrorist attack or criminal activity that can happen anywhere to the assets mentioned above.
  - Any natural disaster that will affect the safety of people lives. This includes hurricanes, volcanoes, and earthquakes.
  - A power outage that may affect the operation flow in the stadium.
- Countermeasures:
  - Screening of fans and their belongings using cameras, sensors and dogs through all gates until reaching their assigned seats.
  - Screening of all transportation systems to make sure it is free of any dangerous items. This is done using high-tech tunnels that have sensors and cameras, similar to those of the baggage screening in the airport, that will detect any potential threat such as bombs, guns, knives,... Not only the high-tech tunnels, but also self-check handled by security guards and trained dogs.
  - Check on all fans through advanced software technologies to make sure they are not of any threat. The check will be through their IDs and the fans' physical features as well.
  - Continuous monitoring and check on any threat inside the stadium through surveillance. The system should be able to detect potential threats through human eyes and advanced technologies as well.
  - Evacuation plans ready and tested in case of any unplanned disasters to make sure everybody is safe. The plans should be tested periodically to make sure of their feasibility.
  - Using generators, and battery-operated machines in addition to some manual work to overcome any sudden power outage in order to maintain the same level of security.
  - Organizing to have ambulances around the stadium that can handle any emergencies that might happen. Securing the ambulances in the police's job. 
  * All previous countermeasures will cost a lot to be done through man hours and purchase of these high-tech equipment. However, this is to prevent/minimize the risk of losing lives or closing the stadium if a threat was successful.
  
## Problem 2
- Scenario: {TSA} - I'm the head of the TSA, I set the rules for screening passengers at airport checkpoints.
- Assumptions:
  - I assume that I'm responsible only for the screening process and not for any land security transportation and its related assets.
  - I assume that team should provide information about any upcoming natural disasters like floods, hurricanes or volcano affecting the screening process and of any other external factors that would affect the operation in the airport such as political laws or agreements that might prevent certain people from entering or leaving the airport, or a medical report that prevents people from specific regions to leave or enter the airport, or the need to do extra medical test or precautions for them. 
  - I assume that all of the employees related to the airport are not of any threat. 
- Assets:
  - Protect the facilities used in the screening process.
  - Protect the life of everyone in the screening process including passengers, employees (humans, and dogs).
- Threats:
  - Any terrorist attack or criminal activity that can happen anywhere to the assets mentioned above.
  - Any natural disasters such as hurricanes, volcanoes, earthquakes.
  - Any medical conditions from a certain region that can be transmitted to others. An example will be of people coming from countries where Zika virus is detected.
  - A power outage that may affect the operation and the screening process flow.
- Countermeasures:
  - Screening of passengers and their belongings using cameras, sensors and dogs through all steps towards their intended airplanes: through the airport gates before entering the airplane, passport/ID inspection gates, and all other steps.  
  - Check on all passengers through advanced software technologies to make sure they are not of any threat. The check will be through their documents' information and the passengers' physical features as well.
  - Continuous monitoring and check on any threat through surveillance. The system should be able to detect potential threats through human eyes and advanced technologies as well.
  - Evacuation plans ready and tested in case of any unplanned disasters to make sure everybody is safe. The plans should be tested periodically to make sure of their feasibility.
  - Continuous update through the system of any new laws or medical conditions that will need special attention and procedures.
  - Using generators, and battery-operated machines in addition to some manual work to overcome any sudden power outage in order to maintain the same level of security.
  - Organizing to have ambulances around the airport that can handle any emergencies that might happen. Securing the ambulances in the police's job as well.
  * All previous countermeasures will cost a lot to be done through man hours and purchase of these high-tech equipment. However, this is to prevent/minimize the risk of losing million of dollars if a threat was successful and we end up closing the airport and canceling flight navigation through it for a while.

## Problem 3
- Scenario: {In charge of a public parking lot}
- Assumptions:
  - I assume that the parking lot is monitored with high-tech surveillance. with outer gates that screen the car and their passengers for any potential threats. 
  - I assume the system assigns cars to the faces of the car passengers. When the car is parked, the driver drops the key into a special box where the system stores it, and only return it back after scanning the face of one of the car passengers who is asking for the car key. I also assume that it is safe and reasonable to give the car key to any of the car passengers with their faces stored in the system. It should be one week of time, then the system will inform the police to come and tow the parked car that stayed for a week in the parking lot. The reason behind the assumption of giving the key to any of the passengers, it to avoid handling the case when something happened to the driver and they still need to take the car to leave.
  - I assume that all of the employees related to the parking lot are not of any threat. 
- Assets:
  - The equipment and the gates and supporting infrastructure of the parking lot.
  - The cars in the parking lot. I'm concerned only with securing them from being stolen or broken from someone.
  - the lives of people inside cars, and the employees working in the lot.
- Threats:
  - Any terrorist attack or criminal activity that can happen anywhere to the assets mentioned above. The criminal activity includes the possibility of stealing a car that doesn't belong to you.
  - A power outage that may affect the operation in the parking lot.
- Countermeasures:
  - Screening of passengers and their belongings using cameras, sensors and dogs through the outer gate. The Check on the passengers is through advanced software technologies to make sure they are not of any threat. The check will be through their IDs and the passengers' physical features as well.
  - Continuous monitoring and check on any theft attempt inside the parking lot through surveillance. The system should be able to detect potential threats through human eyes and advanced technologies as well. The system will automatically record the attempt and call the police.
  - Evacuation plans ready and tested in case of any unplanned disasters to make sure everybody is safe. Any damage to the cars will be out of our responsibility and the insurance companies should cover the costs of such damages.
  - Using generators, and battery-operated machines in addition to some manual work to overcome any sudden power outage in order to maintain the same level of security.
  - Organizing to have ambulances around the stadium that can handle any emergencies that might happen. For example, somebody might get a heart attack while driving the car to or from the parking lot.
  * All previous countermeasures will cost a lot to be done through man hours and purchase of these high-tech equipment. However, this is to prevent/minimize the risk of losing lives or a theft of a car if a threat was successful which will cost us the stolen cars price and our reputation as well.
